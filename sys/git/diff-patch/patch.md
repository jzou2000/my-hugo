To generate a patch from a branch, you need to use the ``git format-patch`` command. This command will create one or more files that contain the changes made in the branch, which you can then send to someone else or apply to another branch. You also need to specify which commits you want to include in the patch, and which branch you want to compare with. For example, if you want to create a patch for all the commits in a branch named feature/new-ui that are not in the master branch, you can use this command:

```sh
git format-patch master..feature/new-ui
```

This will create one file for each commit in the feature/new-ui branch that is not in the master branch. The files will have names like 0001-Commit-message.patch, and they will be stored in the current directory. You can also use the -o option to specify a different output directory, or the --stdout option to print the patch to the standard output instead of creating files.

To apply a patch file to another branch, you need to use the ``git am`` command. This command will read the patch file and apply the changes to the current branch. For example, if you have a patch file named ``0001-Commit-message.patch`` and you want to apply it to the ``master`` branch, you can use these commands:

```sh
git checkout master

git am 0001-Commit-message.patch
```

This will create a new commit on the master branch with the same message and author as the original commit in the patch file. You can also use the ``-3`` option to enable a three-way merge if there are conflicts, or the ``--signoff`` option to add a sign-off line to the commit message.
