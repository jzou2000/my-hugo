## WBC White Blood Cell Count 白血细胞计数

* 3.6 (正常范围 4.0,10.0) going up
* the white blood cell count (WBC) is used as part of a full complete blood count (CBC)
* A high white blood cell count, called leukocytosis (白血球增多), may result from a number of conditions and diseases.
  * Infections 感染
* A low white blood cell count, called leukopenia, can result from conditions such as
  * Bone marrow 骨髓 damage or disorder

## RBC Red Blood Cell Count 红血细胞计数

* 5.68 (4.2,5.4) first abnormal in Sep, going up from 4.41 (Jan) to 5.2 (Jul)
* possible high 增高原因
  * Dehydration
  * Lung (pulmonary) disease 肺病
  * Kidney 肾 or other tumor that produces excess erythropoietin

## CBC Complete Blood Count 血细胞总数

## Hemoglobin 血红蛋白（等于 haemoglobin）；血红素

* 119 (135,170) going up
* The hemoglobin test is often used to check for anemia(贫血), usually along with a hematocrit or as part of a complete blood count (CBC). 
* Low hemoglobin with low RBC count and low hematocrit indicates anemia. 
* High hemoglobin with a high RBC count and high hematocrit indicates polycythemia (红血球增多症).

## Hematocrit 红细胞比容

* 0.39 (0.40,0.50) going up
* The hematocrit test is often used to check for anemia, usually along with a hemoglobin test or as part of a complete blood count (CBC).
* Red blood cells (RBCs) typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood.
* A low hematocrit with low RBC count and low hemoglobin indicates anemia.
* A high hematocrit with a high RBC count and high hemoglobin indicates polycythemia.

## MCV Mean Corpuscular Volume 平均红细胞体积

* 69 (82,98) going down
* The complete blood count (CBC) is often used as a broad screening test to determine your general health status.
* 平均红细胞体积：衡量红细胞平均大小的指标，通常用于诊断贫血和其他血液疾病。

## MCH Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin 平均红细胞血红蛋白

* 21 (27.5, 33.5) going down

## RDW Red Cell Distribution Width 红细胞分布宽度

* 17.6 (11.5,14.5) going up since surgery
* The RDW test is commonly used to help diagnose anemia, including thalassemia (地中海贫血).
* a high RDW and typical MCV suggests an iron, B12, or folate deficiency, or possibly chronic liver disease. a high RDW and low MCV suggests iron deficiency or microcytic anemia. a high RDW and high MCV indicates a lack of B12 or folate, macrocytic anemia, or chronic liver disease.

## Lymphocytes 淋巴球

* 0.6 (1.0,4.0) slightly going up
* To help determine the cause of abnormal results on a white blood cell (WBC) count; to help diagnose and/or monitor an illness affecting your immune system, such as an infection or inflammatory condition, or cancers that affect your white blood cells, such as leukemia (白血病).

## Creatinine 肌酸酐

* 111 (45,110)
* To evaluate the health of your kidneys; to help diagnose kidney disease; to monitor treatment for kidney disease
* Increased creatinine and BUN levels in the blood may mean that your kidneys are not working as they should.
* Low blood levels of creatinine are not common and are not usually a cause for concern.

## Total Bilirubin 总胆红素

* 27 (,17) decrease since Jan (59), normal(15) in Jun, back to 27 (Sep)
* 总胆红素：血液中的一种黄色物质，由肝脏分解血红蛋白产生。总胆红素的测量可以用于评估肝功能和检测黄疸等疾病。
* unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin
* conjugated (direct) bilirubin

## 甲胎蛋白 (α-fetoprotein；AFP)

* 当血清甲胎蛋白超过 400μg /L 且持续超过 1 个月，或 ≥ 200μg /L 持续 2 个月，在排除妊娠、活动性肝病和生殖系胚胎源性肿瘤后，应高度怀疑肝癌，需做 B 超检查，必要时做 CT/MRI 和活组织检查等以明确诊断。
* 部分恶性肿瘤也可能出现AFP升高，如胃癌，结直肠癌等。
* 血清甲胎蛋白可用于肝癌手术切除后或肝癌患者肝脏移植后的随访和复发监测，手术后 2 年内， 建议每 3 个月检测一次，3～5 年内每 6 个月检测一次。
