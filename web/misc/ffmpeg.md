## AllBestApps

* [ffmpeg.js](https://github.com/Kagami/ffmpeg.js/) This library provides FFmpeg builds ported to JavaScript using Emscripten project. Builds are optimized for in-browser use: minimal size for faster loading, asm.js, performance tunings, etc. Though they work in Node as well.
* [Fluent ffmpeg](https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg) This library abstracts the complex command-line usage of ffmpeg into a fluent, easy to use node.js module. In order to be able to use this module, make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your system (including all necessary encoding libraries like libmp3lame or libx264).
