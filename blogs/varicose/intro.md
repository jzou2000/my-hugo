Medical treatment may include:

* Elevation of the legs.
  You may be instructed to elevate your feet above the level of your heart 3 or 4 times a day
  for about 15 minutes at a time. If you need to sit or stand for a long period of time,
  flexing (bending) your legs occasionally can help keep blood circulating.
  If you have mild to moderate varicose veins, elevating your legs can help reduce
  leg swelling and relieve other symptoms.
* Compression stockings.
  These elastic stockings squeeze the veins and prevent blood from pooling.
  Compression stockings can be effective if they are worn every day.
* Sclerotherapy 硬化疗法. 
  Sclerotherapy is the most common treatment for both spider and varicose veins.
  A salt (saline) or chemical solution is injected into the varicose veins.
  They no longer carry blood. And, other veins take over.
* Thermal ablation (切除). Lasers or radiofrequency energy may be used to treat varicose veins.
  A tiny fiber is inserted into a varicose vein through a catheter. The laser or radiofrequency energy
  is used to deliver heat that destroys the wall of the varicose vein.
* Vein stripping.
  This is surgery to remove varicose veins.
* Microphlebectomy.
  Special tools inserted through small cuts (incisions) are used to remove varicose veins.
  It may be done alone or with vein stripping.

微创血管内雷射治疗（Endovascular Laser Treatment简称EVLT）：利用二极体光纤雷射激发血红素在血管中产生热能将血管内皮碳化破坏，进而阻塞萎缩，留在原位慢慢的纤维化，静脉曲张立即消失，对组织破坏性较传统抽除手术小。手术方式类似传统手术，但伤口可以只有针孔大小约2mm以下，用600µm的光纎伸入静脉中，即可达到闭锁静脉的效果。手术伤口极小，术后血肿轻微，术后穿上弹性袜便可行走，恢复期短，疼痛感较轻，感染率低，更适合年长者接受此手术。
